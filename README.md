# MStack Dial Quick Demo

Here's a quick interactive playground for the M5Stack Dial round display which uses the S3 stamp. Rotate the dial to change brightness, tap for a ping, drag a crosshair showing X,Y, press BtnA to change colours, long press for a full screen 'starbust', and long‑press the screen to invert colours.

I made this because the manufacturer libraries and docs seem either too much or too little.

The outer ring is a 'poker chip' style I 3D printed (available on request).

## Purpose

This repo is a hands‑on demo of the core I/O and rendering paths on the Dial (StampS3). Minimal code in C++, no LVGL:

- Touch
  - Tap (with movement threshold) → visual ping + debug log
  - Drag (live X,Y, crosshair overlay)
  - Long press (screen) → invert colours
- Sound
  - Directional click tones on rotary up/down
  - Two‑tone sounds
  - Effect tones (starburst)
- Rotary encoder
  - Accumulator → logical detents (default 10% per step)
  - Event logging and click feedback
- Screen brightness
  - Brightness mapped from 0–100% → 0–255 via `Display.setBrightness`
- Rendering patterns
  - Watch‑face ticks from the physical edge inward
  - Theme‑driven colors (primary/text/accent/ripple)
  - Small‑area snapshot/restore (`readRect`/`pushImage`) overlays to avoid full redraws
- Buttons
  - BtnA press: cycle theme; hold: starburst effect
- Debug & Config
  - Event‑based logs (PRESS/DRAG/RELEASE, ROT, BTN, effects)
  - All tunables in `Config` at the top of `src/main.cpp`

## Controls

- Rotate: brightness (0–100%), watch‑face ticks and big % readout
- Tap: ping (outline shockwave)
- Drag: crosshair follows finger; live X/Y
- BtnA press: cycle colours/theme
- BtnA hold: starburst effect (full‑screen, two‑tone sound)
- Long press (screen): invert display (two‑tone be‑boop)

## Libraries and architecture

- M5Unified — common HAL/shim for input, display, and audio across M5 devices
- M5GFX — fast graphics backend used by M5Unified’s `Display`
- M5Dial — glue for the StampS3 Dial hardware that exposes `Display`, `Touch`, `Encoder`, `Speaker`

No LVGL
- I may add LVGL later but first wanted a simple version. Direct M5GFX calls have lower overhead and avoid additional buffers/complexity. Code stays small and easy to tweak.

How it works:
- Display: `M5Dial.Display` (from M5Unified/M5GFX) for all drawing (lines, circles, text).
- Touch: `M5Dial.Touch` with a tiny state machine to detect tap/drag/long‑press reliably.
- Encoder: `M5Dial.Encoder.readAndReset()` → small accumulator → 10% logical steps, with up/down click tones.
- Speaker: `M5Dial.Speaker.tone(freq, ms)`; a simple timer schedules two‑tone sounds.
- Overlays: small `readRect`/`pushImage` snapshots for crosshair/ping to avoid full‑frame redraws and flicker.

PlatformIO deps (from `platformio.ini`):

```
lib_deps =
  m5stack/M5Dial
  m5stack/M5Unified
  m5stack/M5GFX
```

## Tooling and environment

This project is written in C++ and targets the Arduino framework on ESP32‑S3, using PlatformIO + VS Code for builds and dependency management.

- Use PlatformIO in VS Code as configured in `platformio.ini`.
- Language: C++ (Arduino API via M5Unified/M5GFX)
- Not Arduino IDE: this repo expects PlatformIO’s dependency resolver, multiple envs, and reproducible builds.
- Not MicroPython: this demo leans on fast per‑frame drawing (lines/circles, small overlay blits) and precise input timing; CPython on ESP32S3 adds overhead and different input/audio APIs.
- Not UIFlow 2.0/LVGL: I found UIFlow 2.0 unreliable, slow and locked in. Here we draw directly with M5GFX for lower latency and simpler control.

Why PlatformIO?
- Reproducible: pins exact Espressif platform/toolchains and M5 libraries.
- Multi‑env: dev versus release builds (debug printf on/off) with a simple flag.
- Easy onboarding: open the folder in VS Code, click PlatformIO Build/Upload/Monitor.

## Flash prebuilt binary

  `esptool.py --chip esp32s3 --baud 921600 write_flash -z 0x0 merged-firmware.bin`

## Or build yourself

- Dev build (debug on): `pio run -e dev`
- Release build (debug off): `pio run -e release`
- Upload (dev): `pio run -e dev -t upload`
- Monitor: `pio device monitor -b 115200`

## Event logs to serial

- `[ROT] +10% -> br=70%`
- `[TOUCH] PRESS x=.. y=..`
- `[TOUCH] DRAG start d2=..`
- `[TOUCH] RELEASE dur=.. TAP -> ping`
- `[TOUCH] RELEASE dur=.. invert (no-drag)`
- `[TOUCH] RELEASE dur=.. drag refresh`
- `[BTN] A press -> theme N`
- `[BTN] A hold -> starburst`
- `[EFFECT] Starburst start/end`
- `[PING] end`
